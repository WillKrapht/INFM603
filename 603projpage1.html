<h3>Who We Are and What We Do</h3>
<text>
We are a new nonprofit organization working with the Prince George’s County government to provide supplies to those in quarantine. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, many individuals who are suffering from the virus are in strict quarantine and cannot travel to obtain groceries or home staples. We are aiming to help these individuals by providing some supplies and care.
We have [five] food banks that individuals donate food to, and our volunteers deliver it to our [participants] at their convenience. We keep all dietary restrictions and needed items in mind, so that no one ends up with unusable goods. 
We’re happy to help anyone who needs it. Simply use the form below, let us know what you need, and we’ll be on our way.

our delivery services to aid them.
